[![React Native](https://img.shields.io/badge/React%20Native-v0.67.2-green.svg)](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) [![React Navigation V5](https://img.shields.io/badge/React%20Navigation-v6.0-blue.svg)](https://reactnavigation.org/)

## Prerequisites

- [Node](https://nodejs.org) v14.16 and NPM v7.7.5
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) v1.22.10
- A development machine set up for React Native by following
  [these instructions](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo,
   `git clone https://github.com/manimaran-c/aspiretask`
2. Go to project's root directory, `cd aspiretask`
3. Run `yarn` to install dependencies
4. Start the packager with `yarn start`
5. Connect a mobile device to your development machine
6. Run the test application:

- On Android:
  - Run `react-native run-android` or Use Android Studio (Recommended)
- On iOS:
  - Open `ios/aspireapp.xcworkspace` in Xcode
  - Hit `Run` after selecting the desired device

## Development Points

- Used [mockapi.io](https://6208a5be90422d00173aee9a.mockapi.io/getCardInfo) for API and it's not stable, sometimes you may face timeout issue.
- In `debitcardReducer` given some default values due to unstable condition of mockapi
- As `Avenir Next` font is not available for free, I used `Metropolis` font
- I Used `React Native Paper` for Switch UI, so iOS and Android switches will be different as they are displayed in their native UI

## User Stories

- When a user clicks on Debit Card Details, should be displayed with the Available Balance, based on the API response
- When a user clicks on Show card number, the card numbers & CVV should be visible and eye icon should be strikethrough also the text should be changed into "Hide card number".

- When user click on Weekly spending limit, should be redirected to the Spending limit page.
- Based on the amount spent the Debit card spending limit progress bar should be coloured out in green colour. Also the spent amount should be displayed at the right top of the progress bar with the total spending limit amount. Ex: `S$ 345` | `S$ 5,000`.

- When a user clicks on any options from the default amounts (Ex: S$ 5000, S$ 10000, S$ 20000), should be populated in the "Set a weekly debit card spending limit" field.
  When a user entered or selected the amount, "Save" button should be enabled (By default without any amount, it should be in disabled status).
- When the user clicks on the "Save" button, should be redirected to the "Debit card" page and below changes should happen in the Debit Card page.
